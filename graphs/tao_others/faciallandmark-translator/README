This sample builds on top of the "deepstream-test1" graph to demonstrate how to
use NvDsFacialLandmarks extensions for interoperability with non-DS GXF
components.

The graph contains additional "NvDsFacialLandmarks" extension which include
(PreProcess/PostProcess/NvDsGxfFacialLandmarksTranslator), it will generate a
NvDsFacePointsMetaData user meta and attached it to face object.
NvDsGxfFacialLandmarksTranslator will translate NvDsFacePointsMetaData user meta
to the GXF message and then translator the GXF messages back to face object meta.

$ chmod 775 /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/faciallandmarks
$ chmod 775 /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/facenet
For x86_64 platform
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh App-FacialLandmark.yaml App-FacialLandmark.parameters.yaml -d /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/reference_graphs/common/target_x86_64.yaml
For Jetson
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh App-FacialLandmark.yaml App-FacialLandmark.parameters.yaml -d /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/reference_graphs/common/target_aarch64.yaml

NOTE: App-FacialLandmarks.yaml is the main graph file describing the DeepStream
graph(pipeline) along with the configuration parameters for the components in the
graph. App-FacialLandmarks.parameters.yaml can be used to override these parameter values.
