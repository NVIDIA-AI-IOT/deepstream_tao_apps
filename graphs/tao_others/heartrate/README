This sample builds on top of the "deepstream-test1" graph to demonstrate how to
use NvDsVideoTemplate related extensions.

The graph contains additional "NvDsVideoTemplate" and "NvDsHeartRateTemplateLib"
components required to estimate human heart rate.

================================================================================
Pre-requisites
================================================================================
- DeepStreamSDK 7.0
- Graph-Composer 4.0.0
- Sync extensions from NGC public repo if not already done:
    $ registry repo sync -n ngc-public

================================================================================
Download models for heartrate
================================================================================
1. sudo mkdir -p /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/heartrate
2. sudo wget https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/tao/heartratenet/versions/deployable_v2.0/files/model.etlt \
    -O /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/heartrate/heartrate.etlt

Refer https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_tao_apps/tree/release/tao3.0/apps/tao_others#readme
for more info.

================================================================================
Running the graph
================================================================================
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/lib/cvcore_libs/
$ chmod 775 /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/facenet
$ chmod 775 /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/heartrate
For x86_64 platform
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh App-Heartrate.yaml App-Heartrate.parameters.yaml -d /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/reference_graphs/common/target_x86_64.yaml
For Jetson
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh App-Heartrate.yaml App-Heartrate.parameters.yaml -d /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/reference_graphs/common/target_aarch64.yaml

NOTE: App-Heartrate.yaml is the main graph file describing the DeepStream
graph(pipeline) along with the configuration parameters for the components in the
graph. App-Heartrate.parameters.yaml can be used to override these parameter values.
