This sample builds on top of the "deepstream-test1" graph to demonstrate how to
use NvDsGesture related extensions.

The graph contains additional "NvDsGesture" extension which include (PreProcess),
it will reshape the bbox of the detected hand from NvDsBodyPose2D for the input of NvDsGesture inferencing.

================================================================================
Pre-requisites
================================================================================
- DeepStreamSDK 6.1
- Graph-Composer 1.0.0
- Sync extensions from NGC public repo if not already done:
    $ registry repo sync -n ngc-public

================================================================================
Download models for bodypose2d
================================================================================
1. Prepare bodypose2d model according to bodypose2d/README
2. sudo mkdir -p /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/gesture/
3. sudo wget https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/tao/gesturenet/versions/deployable_v2.0/files/model.etlt \
  -O /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/gesture/gesture_v2.etlt
4. sudo wget https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/models/nvidia/tao/gesturenet/versions/deployable_v2.0/files/int8_calibration.txt \
  -O /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/gesture/cal_v2.txt

Refer https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/deepstream_tao_apps/tree/release/tao3.0/apps/tao_others#readme for more info

================================================================================
Running the graph
================================================================================
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/lib/cvcore_libs/
$ chmod 775 /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/bodypose2d
$ chmod 775 /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/samples/models/tao_pretrained_models/gesture
For x86_64 platform
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh App-Gesture.yaml App-Gesture.parameters.yaml -d /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/reference_graphs/common/target_x86_64.yaml
For jetson
$ /opt/nvidia/graph-composer/execute_graph.sh App-Gesture.yaml App-Gesture.parameters.yaml -d /opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream-6.1/reference_graphs/common/target_aarch64.yaml

NOTE: App-Gesture.yaml is the main graph file describing the DeepStream
graph(pipeline) along with the configuration parameters for the components in the
graph. App-Gesture.parameters.yaml can be used to override these parameter values.
